[[website]()]
Title: KQA Pro: A Large Diagnostic Dataset for Complex Question Answering over Knowledge Base  
Abstract: KQA Pro, a large-scale dataset for Complex KBQA. They generate questions, SPARQLs, and functional programs with recursive templates and then paraphrase the questions by crowdsourcing, giving rise to around 120K diverse instances; They contribute a unified codebase and conduct extensive evaluations for baselines and state-of-the-arts.

## KBQA Systems

## KBQA Papers
(ordered by year)

### 2020

1. **Relationship Search over Knowledge Graphs**  
Author: Dr. Gong Cheng
Abstract: the author introduces their recent studies on relationship search, including search algorithms based on novel index structures, methods for relationship clustering to support result exploration, and query relaxation techniques to provide alternative results for failed searches.  

1. **Scalable Multi-Hop Relational Reasoning for Knowledge-Aware Question Answering**  
Abstract: they propose a novel knowledgeaware approach that equips PTLMs with a multi-hop relational reasoning module, named multi-hop graph relation networks (MHGRN).

1. **Improving Multi-hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs using Knowledge Base Embeddings**  
[[website](https://github.com/malllabiisc/EmbedKGQA)]  
Abstract: EmbedKGQA is particularly effective in performing multi-hop KGQA over sparse KGs. EmbedKGQA also relaxes the requirement of answer selection from a prespecified neighborhood, a sub-optimal constraint enforced by previous multi-hop KGQA methods.

1. **Domain Adaptation for Semantic Parsing**   
[[website](https://github.com/zechagl/DAMP)]  
Abstract: The semantic parser benefits from a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework, thus can provide different and accurate treatments for the two stages, i.e., focusing on domain invariant and domain specific information.

1. **Falcon 2.0: An Entity and Relation Linking Tool over Wikidata**   
[[website](https://labs.tib.eu/falcon/falcon2/)]  
Abstract: Falcon 2.0 resorts to the English language model for the recognition task (e.g., N-Gram tiling and N-Gram splitting), and then an optimization approach for linking task.  

1. **Faithful Embeddings for Knowledge Base Queries**  
Abstract: a novel QE method that is more faithful to deductive reasoning, and show and show that this leads to better performance on complex queries to incomplete KBs.

1. **Compositional Generalization in Semantic Parsing: Pre-training vs. Specialized Architectures**   
Abstract: They investigate state-of-the-art techniques and architectures in order to assess new architectures and techniques' effectiveness in improving compositional generalization in semantic parsing tasks based on the SCAN and CFQ datasets.  

1. **No One is Perfect: Analysing the Performance of Question Answering Components over the DBpedia Knowledge Graph**  
[[website](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10044)]  
Author: Kuldeep Singh  
Abstract: They analyse and micro evaluate the behaviour of 29 available QA components for the DBpedia knowledge graph that were released by the research community since 2010.

1. **A Survey on Complex Question Answering over Knowledge Base: Recent Advances and Challenges**  
[[website](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13069)]  
Author: Bin Fu, Yunqi Qiu, Chengguang Tang, Yang Li, Haiyang Yu, Jian Sun  
Abstract: the author introduce the recent advances in complex QA.

### 2019

1. **Message Passing for Complex Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (CIKM-long paper)**  
[[website](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3357384.3358026)]  
[[code](https://github.com/svakulenk0/KBQA]  
Abstract: a novel approach for complex KGQA that uses unsupervised message passing, which propagates confidence scores obtained by parsing an input question and matching terms in the knowledge graph to a set of possible answers. First, identify entity, relationship, and class names mentioned in a natural language question, and map these to their counterparts in the graph. Then, the confidence scores of these mappings propagate through the graph structure to locate the answer entities. Finally, these are aggregated depending on the identified question type.

1. **Stepwise Reasoning for Multi-Relation Question Answering over Knowledge Graph withWeak Supervision (WSDM-long paper)**  
[[website](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3336191.3371812)]  
Abstract: this paper proposes a neural method based on reinforcement learning, namely Stepwise Reasoning Network, which formulates multirelation question answering as a sequential decision problem.
