Title: KQA Pro: A Large Diagnostic Dataset for Complex Question Answering over Knowledge Base
Abstract: KQA Pro, a large-scale dataset for Complex KBQA. They generate questions, SPARQLs, and functional programs with recursive templates and then paraphrase the questions by crowdsourcing, giving rise to around 120K diverse instances; They contribute a unified codebase and conduct extensive evaluations for baselines and state-of-the-arts.

## KBQA Systems

## Papers
(ordered by year)

### 2020

1. **Scalable Multi-Hop Relational Reasoning for Knowledge-Aware Question Answering**
Abstract: they propose a novel knowledgeaware approach that equips PTLMs with a multi-hop relational reasoning module, named multi-hop graph relation networks (MHGRN).

### 2019

1. **Message Passing for Complex Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (CIKM-long paper)**
[[website](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3357384.3358026)]
[[code](https://github.com/svakulenk0/KBQA]
Abstract: a novel approach for complex KGQA that uses unsupervised message passing, which propagates confidence scores obtained by parsing an input question and matching terms in the knowledge graph to a set of possible answers. First, identify entity, relationship, and class names mentioned in a natural language question, and map these to their counterparts in the graph. Then, the confidence scores of these mappings propagate through the graph structure to locate the answer entities. Finally, these are aggregated depending on the identified question type.
