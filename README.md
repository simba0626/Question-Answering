Title: KQA Pro: A Large Diagnostic Dataset for Complex Question Answering over Knowledge Base
Abstract: KQA Pro, a large-scale dataset for Complex KBQA. They generate questions, SPARQLs, and functional programs with recursive templates and then paraphrase the questions by crowdsourcing, giving rise to around 120K diverse instances; They contribute a unified codebase and conduct extensive evaluations for baselines and state-of-the-arts.

1. **Scalable Multi-Hop Relational Reasoning for Knowledge-Aware Question Answering**
Abstract: they propose a novel knowledgeaware approach that equips PTLMs with a multi-hop relational reasoning module, named multi-hop graph relation networks (MHGRN).
